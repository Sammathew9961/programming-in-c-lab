# **STRING HANDLING FUNCTIONS IN C**

# What are strings?

A string is a datatype used in c programming, such as an integer and floating point unit, but it is used to represent text rather than numbers. It is comprised of a set of characters that can also contain spaces and numbers. The length of a string is often determined by using a null character.

- C language supports a large number of string handling functions that can be used to carry out many of the string manipulations.

- These functions are packaged in string.h library.

- Hence we must include string.h header file in our programs to use these functions.

THERE ARE 18 TYPES OF STRING HANDLING FUNCTION.

IN THIS ASSIGNMENT THERE ARE 12 FUNCTIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MAJOR FUNCTIONS IN STRING.

# 7. **strcmpi()**

This function is same to strcmp, but stcmpi negotiates case &quot;A&quot; and &quot;a&quot; are treated as same.
